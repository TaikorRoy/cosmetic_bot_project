Item
    In the discussion of xpath issue for scrapping items, an item is defined as 
	the data block scrapped from http response that contains all the necessary item components.
	
    Components in one item that need xpath for scrapping:
		vendor_url
		source_name
		price
		scrapping_time
		sales_volume
		comments


    The xpath to locate an item should be the shortest xpath possible to identify all the desired items, which displays as a "box" in the browser.
	The xpath to locate each components in one "item" should be able to identify only one html DOM
